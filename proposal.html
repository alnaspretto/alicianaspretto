 <!--YOUR MARKUP GOES HERE-->     

 
      <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
<em>Alicia Naspretto is a graphic and web designer with experience building websites for non-profits in central Texas. In addition, she’s worked to highlight their impact through her videography and photography work. Examples of this can all be found at <a href="www.alicianaspretto.com">www.alicianaspretto.com. </a> </em><br><br>

      <h3>Target Audience </h3>
<em> The target audience for <a href="www.alicianaspretto.com">www.alicianaspretto.com. </a> will hopefully be future employers or clients. I plan to post this URL to my LinkedIn and have it on my resume. I hope to have different pages on my website that highlight the different skills I can offer. <br>
One page can have screenshots or links to web pages I’ve created that I’m proud of. Another page can have a slideshow of pictures I’ve taken. A third page will show some of my graphic design work and one more for my video work. Finally I hope to have a page with my actual resume or work experience listed. </em> <br> <br> 
      <h3>Competitor Analysis with Examples </h3>
<em>I actually already have a website like the one I am looking to build, however I designed it through GoDaddy instead of building it myself. I also know a few other people who have similar portfolio websites, but again I don’t know anyone who’s built it themselves. I think the fact that mine will be built by me instead of just designed by me gives me more credibility for working on websites.<br>
  <ul>
<li><a href="https://alicianaspretto.godaddysites.com/">https://alicianaspretto.godaddysites.com/ </a> - this is my current site. I like the colors and the set up of it, but again would really like to have built it myself. I would like to add more to the homepage and also find a different way to display my graphic design work. <br>
    <li> <a href="https://www.sydneyzatz.com/"> https://www.sydneyzatz.com/ </a> - this is a portfolio page for a journalist I know. (As a former journalist myself, most of the portfolio pages I know are for other journalists) I don’t really like the set up of her page because when you click the tabs across the top, it doesn’t bring you to a new page, it simply brings you down the homepage to whichever section you’re wanting to see. Since my work is all very different, I want it all on completely different pages. <br>
    <li>  <a href="https://www.elle-meyers.com/">https://www.elle-meyers.com/ </a> - this website is set up a lot better as far as having different pages for each tab, however there is no color anywhere on her page. My current portfolio color is currently yellow and white, which I might carry over to the new one or come up with a new color theme. </em></ul><br> <br>
      
  <h3>Content Strategy </h3>
<em> As mentioned above, the visual content on my page will be the work I’ve created as far as examples of my graphic and web design, photography and videography. I will accompany some of these with captions. More written content will be my work experience and a contact me section. </em><br> <br>
  
  <h3>Navigation</h3>
<em>My page will definitely be more than one page, but I’m not sure exactly how many yet. I would like a homepage introducing the viewer to me and my work. This page will consist of my headshot, a bio, contact info and a few other things to fill it out. Then I would like a &quot;Graphic Design&quot; page that will display some of the graphics I have made, a &quot;Web Design&quot; page to show some of that work, a &quot;Photography&quot; page, a &quot;Videography&quot; page, &quot;Experience&quot; to highlight my resume and I might have a few more if I think of them but this is what I’m think right now. </em> <br> <br>
  
  <h3>Font Families </h3>
  <em> For the fonts, I chose to use Playwrite Cursive as my header and Playfair Display, serif, as my main text. </em>
